## Coverage

End to End (E2E) tests focus on API requests to Klaviyo to ensure revision updates do not break functionality.

Functionally, these test cases cover:

* Lists
    * Lists are fetched when correct klaviyo credentials are supplied in admin
    * An appropriate error shows in Admin if we are unable to fetch lists
* Subscriptions
    * Extension is configured to honor DOI setting:
        * When a customer signs up to the newsletter via the Account Registration Page, the profile is subscribed to the list.
        * When a customer signs up to the newsletter via the footer form, the profile is subscribed to the list.
        * When a customer removes their subscription via the Account management page, the profile is unsubscribed from the list.
        * When a customer adds their subscription via the Account management page, the profile is subscribed to the list.
    * Extension is configured to not honor DOI setting:
        * When a customer signs up to the newsletter via the Account Registration Page, the profile is added to list.
        * When a customer signs up to the newsletter via the footer form, the profile is added to list.
        * When a customer removes their subscription via the Account management page, the profile is removed from the list.
        * When a customer removes their subscription via the Account management page, the profile is added to the list.
